# Genetic_Algorithm
First attempt at solving a genetic problem and optimizing runtime.

This is a program that takes in a target value and an expression length then finds an expression of the given length that evaluates to the target value. Current benchmarks will be recorded on commits, but this project is also to learn more about python, its modules, and IO -- not solely how fast the program can run.
